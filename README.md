# Obsidian-Hugo Skel

This repo represents the "hugo" stuff that surrounds an exported [obsidian](https://github.com/nickpalenchar/obsidian) bundle of markdown documents.

The Obsidian repo (liked above--NOT this one) should clone this repo and add its content to `content/docs`, when building the Obsidian vault for web hosting.
